# *The Key of Ascension: Book One of The Age of the Fallen*

He awoke with no memories, only a name whispered on the edge of agony: **Lucius**.  

Cast into a grim forest, trapped in a foreign, youthful body, he remembered no face, no friend, no enemy. His only companions were searing pain and the terrifying sense that he was something far greater than a lost boy. Fragments of memory flashed in his mind—of power and grandeur, of legions under his command, of fates held in his palm.  

Hunted by beasts born of nightmares and men who saw him as a demon, his only hope lay with the shrouded prophetess **Cassandra**. She held the key to his past.  

To reach her, Lucius must descend into the harsh reality of a city where trust is a luxury and every act of kindness could be a trap. Struggling to survive, his forgotten nature begins to stir. A force—ancient and dreadful—rises within him. And with it, the name the heavens cursed.  

**His name is Lucifer. The Fallen Angel.**  

Now, he must find **Sol Oriens**—the Key of Ascension, a mighty artifact that could restore his full power. But he is not the only one searching.  

To reclaim the heavens, he must embrace his humanity.  
But in a world that wishes to see him fall again, **can an angel find redemption?**
