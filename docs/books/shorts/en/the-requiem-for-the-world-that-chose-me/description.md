*If you could escape to a better life... would you?*

From his earliest memories, the protagonist of this story knows he doesn't belong in his worldâ€”a world of grey, coldness, and a broken plastic airplane. But sometimes, in moments of deepest pain, reality cracks, and he glimpses a world beyond: a parallel life where his other self is happy, loved, and whole.

For years, these visions have been both a curse and a salvation. Now, however, the time has come for a choice. A choice between the familiar pain and the unknown hope that lies beyond the veil of reality.

**Requiem for the World That Chose Me** is a poignant story about trauma, the resilience of the human spirit, and the yearning to find one's true place. A story that will make you ask yourself: What is the price of happiness, and are we willing to pay it?
