# Echoes of Tomorrow

## The Last Transmission

The message came through on a quiet Tuesday afternoon, buried in the static of a thousand radio frequencies. Dr. Sarah Chen had been monitoring the deep space array for years, listening for any sign of intelligent life beyond our solar system. Most days, she heard nothing but the cosmic background radiation, the faint whisper of the universe itself.

But today was different.

The signal was weak, barely distinguishable from the noise, but there was a pattern to it. A sequence of prime numbers, followed by a series of mathematical equations that described the structure of DNA. And then, just as suddenly as it had appeared, it was gone.

Sarah sat back in her chair, her hands trembling. This was itâ€”the moment she had been waiting for. The first confirmed contact with an extraterrestrial intelligence.

But as she began to analyze the data, something strange happened. The equations started to change, evolving before her eyes. They were learning, adapting to her attempts to understand them.

And then, in the silence of the laboratory, she heard it. A voice, speaking in perfect English.

"Hello, Dr. Chen. We've been waiting for you."

The message wasn't coming from the speakers. It was in her mind, clear as day. And as she listened, she realized something terrifying.

They weren't from another planet.

They were from the future.
