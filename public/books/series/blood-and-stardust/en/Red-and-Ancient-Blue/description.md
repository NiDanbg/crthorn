For him, there is no past, no name, only vague images from another life that seems not to belong to him. Realizing that his only chance to understand who he is and why he's here is to trust his instincts, Nick embarks on a journey that takes him from the muddy roads of an unfamiliar province to pursuits and secret battles, far from his usual life as a university professor.
