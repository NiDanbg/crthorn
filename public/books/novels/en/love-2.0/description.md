## Love 2.0: Algorithm for Love or Love Beyond Algorithms?
Love doesn’t need an algorithm. Or does it?

Claude Sullivan is a brilliant programmer, but when it comes to social interactions—especially with women—he’s a complete disaster. The world of code is his safe haven: logical, predictable, controllable. People? They’re a chaotic bug in the system.

Everything changes when Edith Dupont, the new, dazzlingly intelligent and charming head of marketing, joins the tech startup Nolans Tech. For Claude, it’s love at first line of code. Desperate to overcome his awkwardness and win her heart, he does what he does best—he creates a technological solution.

Meet "Algo"—his secret, ultra-modern AI assistant, programmed to analyze every social situation, predict reactions, and suggest the perfect responses. With Algo by his side, Claude begins navigating the complex world of flirting and romance, and Edith seems increasingly intrigued.

But what happens when the simulation becomes too real?

As Claude tries to balance Algo’s advice with his own budding feelings, the line between authenticity and manipulation begins to blur. Can a relationship built on artificial intelligence be real? And what happens when Edith discovers the truth behind his newfound confidence?

"Love 2.0" is more than a romantic comedy. It’s a smart, entertaining, and heartfelt story that skillfully weaves humor, romance, and an unexpected technological thriller. As Claude and Edith battle their own demons and the complicated dynamics of the workplace, they find themselves caught in a corporate conspiracy that threatens not just their jobs—but something much bigger. If you love someone…

...then Love 2.0 is the book for you!
