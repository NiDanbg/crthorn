**What happens when the journey has no final stop, and the passengers have no memories?**

---

Deep in the Andes, shrouded in impenetrable mist, an old bus makes its way. Inside it are a handful of strangers, each carrying an emptiness where their past should be. Elena wakes up on one of the worn-out seats with no memory of how she got there or where she's headed. The only one who knows the way is the enigmatic driver, whose eyes hold secrets older than the mountains themselves.

But this is no ordinary journey. With every turn along the treacherous mountain road, the mist outside reveals not landscapes but fragments of forgotten lives and buried truths. Every stop is an encounter with a personal hell or heaven—a place of reckoning where the passengers must face the demons they've been running from. Some find peace. Others vanish into the mist forever. And still others are forced to continue the journey.

As Elena struggles to piece together the puzzle of her identity, she realizes the bus isn’t just transporting them—it's guiding them toward the deepest corners of their souls. And to find her way, she must first remember how she died.

**The Bus of the Lost is** a haunting and poetic novella about the boundary between life and death, the power of forgiveness, and the love that can traverse even the abyss of oblivion. A journey from which no one returns the same.

**Board if you dare. The road awaits.**
